CODSOFT (Task-1)
Titanic Survival Detection:- 

The project examines Titanic dataset information with an objective to forecast passenger survival outcomes. The process starts with data cleaning followed by explorative data analysis. Data findings demonstrate gender along with passenger class as major contributing elements to survival rates that benefited women and individuals in upper-class categories. The predictions generated by the trained model perform accurate survival outcomes assessments through its use of data features extracted from the original dataset.
